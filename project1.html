        <h1>TEXT BASED GAME</h1>
        <p>That was a group project. Beginning of the game, we are
            creating a user and assign characteristic features. The user
            selects these features. In the next steps of the game, the user
            generates rooms by throwing dice, and base on the dice
            throwing, the user encounters some from different levels of
            enemies in those rooms. In encounter parts, we are throwing
            the dice to win or lose against our enemy or enemies. </p>
